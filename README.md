# DB Model for Express.js _(v 0.0.1)_
DB Model is a library for Express.js projects which would help in the elimination of SQL queries in codes (cleaner codes). 

It is basically an ORM (Object Relation Model) limited to MySQL for now but plans are in place to extend to other SQL and NoSQL.

## Installation
Install via NPM using the command below:
> npm install db-model@latest
